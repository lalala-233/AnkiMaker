## About

AnkiMaker is a useful software that can generate flashcards for Anki.

But now, AnkiMaker can only generate flashcards for Chinese classical poetry and can only generate cards in a `.txt` format that can be imported by Anki.

## Prerequisites

To import the flashcards generated by AnkiMaker, you'd better use the latest version of Anki.

If the version you using is too old (<=2.1.54), the flashcards may not be imported correctly.
